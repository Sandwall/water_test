We'll be using the following libraries that go in this directory:
- GLFW for window and OpenGL context initialization. Follow the instructions in the main README and copy the headers into a folder called `GLFW` here)
- gl3w for OpenGL extension loading. I've already setup and placed the needed headers in this folder.
